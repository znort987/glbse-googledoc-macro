How to use the fetchTicker macro
================================

    . Go and create a new spreadsheet document in Google Docs
    . Go to Menu->Tools->Script Editor
    . A new window open that lets you edit code
    . Delete all of the existing code in there and paste the code found in file fetchTicker.js
    . Press the 'Save' button above the code (the stylized floppy disk icon)
    . Press the 'Run' button (stylized '>')

At this point, you can go back to your spreadsheet window,
and enter formulas that use the fetchTicker call.

For example, in cell A1, you can enter:

    =fetchTicker("COGNITIVE", "ask")/100000000

And you should see the current ask for COGNITIVE appeat in cell A1
