How to use the fetchAddrInfo macro
==================================

    . Go and create a new spreadsheet document in Google Docs
    . Go to Menu->Tools->Script Editor
    . A new window open that lets you edit code
    . Delete all of the existing code in there
    . Paste the code found in file fetchAddrInfo.js
    . Press the 'Save' button above the code (the stylized floppy disk icon)
    . Press the 'Run' button (stylized '>')

At this point, you can go back to your spreadsheet window,
and enter formulas that use the fetchAddrInfo call.

For example, in cell A1, you can enter:

    =fetchAddrInfo("1dice37EemX64oHssTreXEFT3DXtZxVXK", "final_balance")/100000000

And you should see the current balance for address 1dice37EemX64oHssTreXEFT3DXtZxVXK
appear in cell A1
